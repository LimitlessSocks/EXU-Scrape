● If this card is Special Summoned OR a Fusion Monster(s) that lists "Elemental HERO Neos" as material is Special Summoned from your Extra Deck while you control this card: You can add 1 “Miracle Contact”, “Convert Contact”, “Connected Contact”, “NEX”, or “NEXT” from your Deck to your hand. 
● If a Fusion Monster(s) you control that lists "Elemental HERO Neos" as material would be shuffled into the Extra Deck by its own effect, you can shuffle 1 “Neo-Spacian” monster from your GY into the Deck instead.
