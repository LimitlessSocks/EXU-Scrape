If this card is Xyz Summoned: You can detach 1 Monster Card material from this card; add 1 Level 9 non-DARK Wyrm monster with a different Attribute from the detached material from your Deck to your hand, then, if you detached a Wyrm monster to activate this effect, and that monster is now in the GY or banished, all face-up monsters your opponent currently controls become the Attribute of that monster. You can only use this effect of "True King of Dimension's End" one per turn. Monsters that Level 9 Wyrm monsters in your hand would destroy with their effects can be chosen from your opponent's field. Any card destroyed by your card effect and sent to your opponent's GY is banished instead.
