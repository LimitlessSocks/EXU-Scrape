Must first be Special Summoned with "Polymerization". Cannot be destroyed by card effects if it was Fusion Summoned using “Des Frog” or an Xyz Monster as material. You can Tribute 1 Aqua monster from your hand or field, then target 1 card on your opponent controls; negate that target’s effects if it is face-up and this card was Fusion Summoned using a Fusion or Xyz Monster as material, also destroy that target, and if you do, you can Set it to your field, and if you do that, if it is a Trap or Quick-Play Spell, it can be activated this turn. This is a Quick Effect if there is a card in your Field Zone. You can only use this effect of “Toadally Ridiculous” once per turn. If this card leaves the field by your opponent’s card: You can Special Summon 1 “D.3.S Frog” from your Extra Deck.
