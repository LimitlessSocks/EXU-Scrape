    <h1>Azuroth the Unholy Light/Azuroth the Demon King</h1>
    <h2>How to Play!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>"Azuroth the Demon King" enters the Duel with 4000 LP, and uses its own Deck as shown.
            <ol><li>It is recommended that if a player has or can become "Azuroth the Demon King" that they use the "Azuroth the Demon King" card to represent as such, if available.</li></ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            When a player becomes "Azuroth the Demon King", they banish all cards that "Azuroth the Demon King" does not own, face-down.
            <ol>
                <li>If necessary, a player can instead use cards they own to represent cards that "Azuroth the Demon King" owns by denoting as such.
                    <ol><li>A player cannot have at least 2 copies of any 1 card represent 2 different cards.</li></ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            "Azuroth the Demon King" enters the Duel by shuffling the Deck it owns and drawing 4 cards. It then immediately starts its turn.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Clarifying Rules for Competitive(?) Play</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>A player can start the Duel as "Azuroth the Demon King" outside of a competitive setting if all players agree.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    More than 1 player can become "Azuroth the Demon King".
                    <ol><li>Players do not share Decks if multiple players become "Azuroth the Demon King".</li></ol>
                </li>
                <li>A player cannot become "Azuroth the Demon King" unless a card or effect allows them to do so.</li>
                <li>If all players agree to the following at the start of the Match, it may apply: "If a player that has become "Azuroth the Demon King" is attacked by a player equipped with "Benevolence of the Demonsbane" and their LP becomes 0, they lose the Match."</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>If a Chain is resolving and a player loses the Duel before the effect of "Azuroth the Unholy Light" would apply to them, they do not become "Azuroth the Demon King".</li>
        <li>A player that has become "Azuroth the Demon King" is still a player.
            <ol>
                <li>A player that has become "Azuroth the Demon King" cannot lose the Duel by drawing with no cards in their Deck.</li>
                <li>A player that has become "Azuroth the Demon King" still loses the Duel by their opponent's effects that win the Duel.</li>
