# Staff Rules

Failure to meet these guidelines on a regular basis may result in demotion or demodding. All guidelines are in addition to regular server rules.

## 1. Courtesy
1. Staff should be courteous, helpful, and civil.
2. Insulting, berating, or abusing members, including other staff, is prohibited.
3. Do not take sides.
4. Leave your personal feelings aside at the start of a dispute between members.
5. Your role is to moderate and make sure proper conduct is followed, that includes from yourself and other staff.

## 2. Privacy
1. It is prohibited to leak information such as private conversations from the staff text channels unless given explicit permission by Red.
2. Any sharing must be name redacted in order to protect staff from targeting.

## 3. Humility
1. Don't take yourself too seriously.
2. You're a staff member in a Discord server. Don't be pretentious, snarky, or narcissistic about your rank.

## 4. Authority
1. Do not challenge the authority of fellow staff members outside of staff channels.
2. We work as a team. If you have a problem with an official decision of another staff member, take it up in staff channels.

## 5. Cooperation
1. Be cooperative.
2. We will not tolerate bringing up old drama or pot-stirring.

## 6. Don't Troll
1. Do not change the nickname or roles of a member against their will.
2. We will not tolerate muting, warning, kicking, or banning any members without a properly logged (and legitimate) reason.

## 7. Staff Breaking Rules
1. If you see a staff member breaking rules, please ping Red, and provide the following:
    1. Time and Date:
    2. Which rule(s) they have broken:
    3. Evidence (i.e screenshots, link(s) to the chat):
    4. Backstory/context:

## 8. Dealing with Bad Behavior

In addition to the above, the following steps are to be taken during any dispute outside of an immediate ban (e.g. porn, etc. as usual):
1. A verbal warning to stop the stated behavior with a clear outline of the upcoming mute if it's not stopped.
2. A 15 minute mute.
3. Either a longer mute or a warning should the behavior warrant it for clear rule violation with no other mitigating factors, e.g. staff/other users goading/escalation/other.
4. Should the behavior be continued a 24 hour mute pending a vote to ban, as usual.

## 9. Staff Roles

1. **Trainees:** Trainees typically have the same responsibilities in terms of prior conduct rules as full staff members, of course, and are expected to uphold them all the same.
    1. Permissions are different for trainees to prevent abuse of power; namely banning, kicking, etc.
    2. However, given our formal process for doing these things, it shouldn't be a hassle, as you won't need to do that on your own anyway!
2. **Pre-CAT:** Card Approval Team trainees first get the role 'Pre-CAT Team'.
    1. This is utilized because the CAT Team is our first and foremost important aspect of staff in terms of reviewing
    2. In essence, we let trainees break their feet in first before immediately giving them the full CAT Team role.
    3. Be sure to keep up, review submissions (post your opinions in the cat-team channel for example), participate in VC meetings and be active to better your chances at being promoted to the full CAT Team!
    4. Pre-CAT trainees cannot react to submissions without permission from a full staff member or a staff member with the Senior Staff role.
        1. HOWEVER, you can react to submissions freely in VC meetings as they are with other full staff.
3. **Testing Trainee:** If you are a trainee on the Testing Team, this means you can test and mark submissions up for testing!
    1. Refer to the submission-rules channel about reactions specifically for the Testing Team.
    2. Be sure to post reports of tested cards/Decks in the testing-team channel, as well as your overall verdict and the replay(s) of it being played.
    3. You can ping other Testing Team members to in-house test with them or you can test solo! The choice is yours!
4. **PSCT Trainee:** PSCT Team trainees can post PSCT checks in the psct-team channel to be checked.
    1. Refer to submission-rules for reactions specific to PSCT Team members.
    2. Be sure to ping Red (he's kind of a perfectionist) so potential revisions can be made!
    3. Once done, be sure to post the finalized PSCT and ping the creator in the psct-checking channel.
    4. After that, mark the submission as appropriate for before and after the PSCT changes are applied. It's that easy!
5. **Promotion:** It is primarily up to those with the Senior Staff role and simply other full staff members in general in regards to promoting trainees.
    1. Depending on your conduct, activity and amount of work done, promotion can be quite easy to achieve!
6. If you're unsure of something, don't be afraid to ask!
7. If you want to propose something - poll it in staff-news!
    1. Depending on your role you may need to ping a full staff member to ping all the appropriate roles - but democracy is democracy.
    2. This also applies to staff applications; all staff and trainees have the ability to vote in them - that's our primary system for polls and staff applications.
8. **Banlist Team:** The Banlist Team is comprised of those in staff who actively play and oversee the format (decided by Red, mostly).
    1. The banlist is done in essentially two stages: Compiling a list of cards to discuss and making a thread for each individual card/Deck, until a consensus is made on each one by staff.
    2. Then, staff do a democratic vote on the contested/controversial cards.
    3. After that, a finalized list is made and posted!
9. **Sending Feedback:** To send feedback for a submission, be sure to note its number of reactions (3 no's means denied, 3-4 warnings means warn).
    1. Gather all the information and/or ask all involved in the submission, then formulate a formal feedback that is polite and generally friendly to the creator.
    2. Be sure to use the EXU bot in cat-team with its simple-to-use `/feedback` command.
    3. If you are a trainee, contact a staff member for approval beforehand.
10. **Approving Cards:** When approving cards, be sure to put them in the appropriate channels with the following formats for each.
    1. For singles that support something, put them in approved-singles for example.
    2. There are 3 channels: approved-singles, approved-support and approved-archetypes.
    3. Be sure to contact a full staff member if you are a trainee beforehand.
    4. Only submissions with 4 check marks are able to be approved.
    5. Format:

           Singles:
           X cards @Creator's **Card Name**
           https://www.duelingbook.com/card?id=X

           Support:
           X cards @Creator's **Support Name**
           https://www.duelingbook.com/deck?id=X

           Archetypes:
           X cards @Creator's **Archetype Name**
           https://www.duelingbook.com/deck?id=X
           (Provided Image Of Archetype Attached)

## 10. Accountability

1. Staff accountability and activity are taken very seriously.
2. If you are a staff member, you are expected to be both be here and to do work.
3. An unexcused absence of 2 weeks will result in an inactivity warning.
4. Please see our [rules for how we handle staff activity](./start.html) for more information.
