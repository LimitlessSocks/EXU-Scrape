# The Staff Review Team (StaRT)
## 0. Overview and Conditions
1. The Staff Review Team (or StaRT) is a collective of staff members, appointed by and including Red.
2. StaRT duties are to help manage the composition and role distribution of EXU staff.
3. The members of StaRT form a committee, and all decisions are reached by approval of a majority of active StaRT members.
4. **Server Owner Approval:** All StaRT decisions are subject to Red's approval and veto, which are final.
	1. No StaRT decision may be acted upon unless Red has explicitly signed off on it.
5. **StaRT composition:** Red has executive control over the composition of StaRT, and may promote or demote any staff member to StaRT as he sees fit for any reason at any time.
6. **Temporary Final Executor:** Red has the authority to, for an explicit period of time not surpassing 2 weeks at a time, temporarily appoint one member of StaRT to act in his stead as final executor.
	1. At any point during this temporary appointment, Red may unilaterally take back the role of final executor.
	2. If Red is inactive for a period of time, such that no temporary final executor has been appointed, or if the period of time for the final executor expires without Red's renewal in light of his absence, StaRT is frozen, and may not act or execute its duties.
7. **Good Faith:** Red retains final say on the interpretation, implementation, and revision of these guidelines in rules with his version for the server.
	1. However, no person shall be subject to any formal revisions of these rules after the fact.

## 1. Duties of StaRT
1. Regularly examine the staff roster for promotions and inactivity.
2. Monitor activity and inactivity to inform corresponding decisions.
3. Composing promotion and warning messages to be dispensed collectively.
4. Monitor staff applications, and post them in #staff-news (pinged) for a staff-wide vote.
5. Apply these rules faithfully and expeditiously, in accordance to their spirit and Red's vision. See §5 (Fair Review).

## 2. Inactivity
1. Staff members who are inactive for more than 2 weeks to the present day without their __explicit prior notice__ (§3) must be issued an **inactivity warning**.
	1. *Justification Exclusivity:* All inactivity warnings must be issued based exclusively on inactivity in the 2 week period preceding the warning.
	2. *Activity Border Period:* If a staff member is inactive for 2 weeks, then active again during a subsequent period of at least 24 hours of time (not of work), and StaRT did not act upon that inactivity by the end of that bordering period, they may not act upon it in the future, nor use it as evidence for future decisions. See §5 (Fair Review) for rules on the nature of StaRT decisions.
	3. *Transparency and Notification:* Inactivity warnings are posted in #staff-news (unpinged) for transparency's sake, and also DM'd to the inactive staff member.
	4. *Descriptiveness:* Inactivity warnings are descriptive, consist of explicit places where StaRT would like to see improvement, especially identifying pivotal roles belonging to the warned staff member (e.g., CAT Team).
2. When an inactivity warning is dispensed, the **activity examination period begins**.
	1. The activity examination period lasts an additional 2 weeks from the date the inactivity warning is dispensed. 
	2. During this period, the warned staff member is expected to show improvement in the identified areas.
	3. It is the job of StaRT to monitor closely this warned staff member's contributions during this period.
	4. ❗ As the warning is dispensed, an individual may give __explicit prior notice__ (§3) to delay the activity examination period (but not the warning itself).
3. At the end of the activity examination period, StaRT decides whether or not the individual's contributions at least meet the expectations outlined in the warning.
4. If StaRT decides an individual has not met the activity thresholds at the end of the activity examination period, the individual is immediately demodded. They are notified of this via DMs, and their demodding is posted in #staff-news (unpinged) for transparency's sake.
	1. See §5 (Fair Review) for rules on the nature of StaRT decisions.
5. If they *have* met activity thresholds, they leave the activity examination period and enter **Inactivity Probation** (§4).

## 3. Explicit Prior Notice
1. A staff member may indicate their extended absence (for any duration) with any of the following methods of __Explicit Prior Notice__:
	1. A DM to Red;
	2. A ping to @StaffReviewTeam in any staff channel; or
	3. Any method of communication in the event of dire emergency (e.g., death in the family, extended power outage, illness, etc.)
2. ❗ If Method §3.1.3 Explicit Prior Notice is provided after a warning is dispensed, StaRT should reverse the warning, assuming good faith on all parties.
	1. If StaRT suspects abuse in this regard, they may decide to instead immediately demod the staff member abusing method 3.
	2. See §5 (Fair Review) for rules on the nature of StaRT decisions.

## 4. Inactivity Probation
1. After a successful inactivity review period, the affected staff member enters a period of Inactivity Probation for **6 months**, and becomes a "probationer".
2. If, for any continuous 2 week segment of Inactivity Probation, the probationer is eligible for an inactivity warning, StaRT may decide to instead immediately demod the probationer.
3. After the Inactivity Probation period passes, the probation is lifted, and their probation is not to be considered in future StaRT decisions in accordance with §5.1.1.2.

## 5. Fair Review
 1. When StaRT sets out to decide collectively on a course of action, they must do so
	1. Fairly:
		1. StaRT should use only immediately relevant factors when making decisions.
		2. In particular, when deciding, StaRT shall **NOT** use external factors including, but not limited to, (a) conduct, (b) previous inactivity warnings, (c) previous inactivity probations, (d) recency or longevity of staff tenure, (e) status as staff member or trainee, (f) or mere number of roles or jobs.
		3. The only exceptions to §5.1.1.2 are:
			1. When deciding if a staff member is abusing the system as outlined in §3.2.1;
			2. When deciding promotions.
	2. Expeditiously:
		1. StaRT should not prolong decisions more than necessary.
		2. StaRT members should not engage in rhetoric with the effect of unduly prolonging the process, or circumventing the spirit of these rules.
## 6. Petition 
 1. If at any point during the process, any staff member feels StaRT is not doing their job to the spirit or letter of these rules, they may petition StaRT.
 2. StaRT must fairly, honestly, and expeditiously consider the petition.
