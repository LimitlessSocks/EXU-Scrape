            <div id="description"><p>Darkwater is a grindcentric Midrange deck, focused on banishing its own Spells and Traps from the GY to recur cards and destroy cards your opponent controls. It has ways to repeatedly set up the same 2 disruptions each turn, recursion and ability to function as a beatdown strat on its own turn.</p>

   <p>Every main deck monster is a Level 6 DARK Aqua monster with stats around the 2300 - 2500 ATK and 2400 - 2600 DEF range. With pendulum scales of 3 and 7, 2 of them are Normal monsters that fetch another scale from the Deck as a pendulum effect. The other 4 (Fishook, Penrod, Angler and Wheelback) all have a pendulum scale effect to banish 1 card from the field, face-up Extra Deck(s), GY(s) and hand(s) respectively if a "Darkwater" monster inflicts battle damage to the opponent. Then they all have effects to banish other Darkwater cards from the Deck, face-up Extra Deck, GY and hand respectively on summon, as well as searching and recurring cards when banished, but the effects are H1OPT.</p>

   <p>The deck's flow is achievable through its normal trap, special summoning a Darkwater monster from the Deck or face-up Extra Deck on activation, that can then either search, or banish the trap that summoned it to destroy a card on the field. Its counter trap enhances the disruptive capabilities and protects the rest of the setup.</p>

   <h4>Utility cards</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>Allure of Darkness is the best draw spell</li>
    <li>Gold Sarcophagus is an excellent toolbox card</li>
    <li>Aloof Lupine is very fitting, since the deck does not need its Normal Summon</li>
    <li>Access to the Rank 6 Toolbox</li>
    <li>Great synergy with custom generic link 2s like Rooftop Inu, Abyss Insurgent and Spawn of Exile.</li>
