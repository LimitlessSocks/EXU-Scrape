● If a card(s) your opponent controls is destroyed by a card effect and sent to the GY: You can banish that opponent's card(s).
● Once per turn (Quick Effect): You can target 1 card in either player's GY that was destroyed by a card effect this turn; equip it to a "Scattershot" monster you control as an Equip Spell that gives it 500 ATK, and if you do, send this card to the GY.
You can only use each effect of "Scattershot Sniper" once per turn.
