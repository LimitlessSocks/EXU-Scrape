[10234077] from: (This card is not treated as a "Ninja" card.)
If you control no monsters, or all monsters you control that you own are "Popping Prowess" monsters (min. 1), you can Special Summon this card (from your hand). You can only Special Summon "Ninja of Popping Prowess - Ascended Shadow" once per turn this way. Once per turn (Quick Effect): You can Special Summon 1 "Popping Prowess Tactics Token" (DARK/Beast-Warrior/Level 1/ATK 1000/DEF 1000), or, if you cannot, place 1 Shinobi Counter on this card. While that Token is in the Monster Zone, the player that Summoned it cannot Tribute Summon non-"Popping Prowess" monsters or Special Summon monsters from the Extra Deck, except "Popping Prowess" monsters. Monsters you control gain 200 ATK/DEF for each "Popping Prowess Tactics Token" you control and each Shinobi Counter on the field. Once per Chain, when a card or effect is activated that would cause a face-up "Popping Prowess" card(s) you control to leave the field (Quick Effect): You can Tribute 1 "Popping Tactics Token" you control OR remove 1 Shinobi Counter from your field for each card(s) that would leave the field because of that card or effect; negate the activation. If a face-up "Popping Prowess" monster you control would be destroyed by battle, you can Tribute 1 "Popping Tactics Token" you control OR remove 1 Shinobi Counter from your field instead.
